Welcome to the CCC October 2023 Solution Repository! This repository contains my code solutions for the [Cloudflight Coding Contest October 2023](https://register.codingcontest.org/). Feel free to explore, learn and contribute.

The CCC (short for Cloudflight Coding Contest) is one of the biggest competitions of its kind. Each Spring and Autumn over 4,000 coders from all around the world simultaneously compete against each other in level-based coding games. With each level the difficulty increases and the candidate (or team) reaching the highest level within the shortest time wins.
